📝 **Project Summary**:  
In this project, I analyzed a customer purchase dataset using Microsoft Excel. I entered raw data related to customer orders including products, categories, quantity, price, and region. A new column, *Total Purchase*, was calculated using basic formulas to determine the amount spent per order. I then created Pivot Tables to summarize the data: one showing total spending by each customer, and another showing total quantity sold per product. Conditional formatting was used to visually enhance the Total Purchase column using data bars.

This project strengthened my Excel skills in data entry, basic calculations, and quick data analysis using pivot tables.
